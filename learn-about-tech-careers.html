        </div>
        <p>Tech is everywhere, in the apps you use, the music you stream, the transport you take, and even the way food
            is
            delivered. But behind all of that are real people solving real problems with creativity, logic, and
            innovation.
        </p>
        <p>And guess what? You could be one of them.</p>
        <p>Tech isn't just for people who've been coding since they were kids. It's for anyone who's curious, willing to
            learn, and excited about shaping the future. Whether you're into design, numbers, people, or storytelling,
            there's a place for you in tech.</p>
        <p>Let's take a look at some of the different paths you could follow:</p>

        <p>Developers create the apps, websites, and tools we use every day, from banking apps and video games to
            booking systems and chat platforms. It;s about solving problems with code, thinking logically, and turning
            ideas into reality.</p>
        <p><i>Think about your favourite game, like Call of Duty or Fifa, a team of developers made that experience
                possible from the ground up.</i></p>
